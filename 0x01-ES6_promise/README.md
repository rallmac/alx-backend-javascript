This is javascript promises. promises are functions that work like
callBack functions but better than callBack functions

javascript promises work like reallife promises. If cetain criterias are met,
a partcular logic executes. if cetain criterias are also met, a certain logic
also executes and so on and so forth, with reguard to a breaking point in
case otherwise.
